I am a Ph.D. student in Experimental Particle Physics. I am working on a data analysis using large experiment data from the <a href="http://atlas.ch">ATLAS experiment</a> at <a href="http://cern.ch">CERN</a>.
<br>
Although I really enjoyed my life as a physicist, I am preparing a transition from academia to Data Science, and I am very excited!

<h2>Transition to Data Science</h2>


I started preparing for the transition to data science little more than a year ago. I have learned core concepts of data science including building predictive models using machine learning and data interpretation with statistical method. I found that many aspects of data science such as data mining, processing, and analyzing are very similar to physics analyses. I also worked on a few <a href="{{site.url}}/projects.html">data science projects</a> for better understanding of the concepts and gaining work experience.

<h2>Skill Sets</h2>
I am experienced with useful <b>Python</b> libraries:

<br>
<b>pandas</b>, <b>numpy</b> for data processing
<br>
<b>matplotlib</b>, <b>seaborn</b>, <b>plotly</b> for visualization
<br>
<b>scikit-learn</b> for machine learning (model selection, regression, classification, PDA)
<br>
I am also familiar with <b>Jupyter</b> notebook and <b>SQL</b>.

<br><br>
I am also experienced with traditional programming environment:
<br>
<b>C++, Linux (bash, ssh), svn, Github, and LaTex.</b>
